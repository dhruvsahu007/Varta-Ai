```

### Test Patterns

#### 1. **Mocking Strategy**
- External APIs (OpenAI) are mocked for predictable testing
- Database operations use in-memory mocks
- WebSocket connections are simulated
- File system operations are mocked

#### 2. **Test Data**
- Realistic sample data for channels, messages, users
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error scenarios and invalid inputs

#### 3. **Assertions**
- Comprehensive validation of responses
- Performance benchmarks and thresholds
- Error message validation
- Data consistency checks

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Targets
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms for simple operations
- **AI Processing**: < 200ms for tone analysis, < 1s for reply generation
- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: < 50ms for single message
- **API Endpoints**: < 500ms for most operations
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks, < 1MB increase per test cycle

### Load Testing Scenarios
- **50 concurrent users** with 5 actions each
- **100 burst operations** (mix of DB, AI, WebSocket)
- **10,000 message array processing** for UI performance

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
- **Environment**: jsdom for React components, node for backend
- **Coverage**: Statements, branches, functions, lines
- **Module Mapping**: Path aliases for imports
- **Setup Files**: Global mocks and test utilities

### Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=test
OPENAI_API_KEY=test-key
DATABASE_URL=test-db-url
SESSION_SECRET=test-secret
```

## 📋 Test Reporting

### Comprehensive Report (`npm run test:all`)
The test runner generates a detailed report including:

- ✅ **Test Results** - Pass/fail counts by category
- 📊 **Code Coverage** - Lines, functions, branches, statements
- ⚡ **Performance Metrics** - Response times and benchmarks
- 💡 **Recommendations** - Actionable improvement suggestions
- 🚨 **Critical Issues** - Must-fix problems before deployment

### Coverage Reports
- **HTML Report**: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- **JSON Summary**: `coverage/coverage-summary.json`
- **Console Output**: Real-time coverage metrics

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Tests
1. **Identify Test Category** - Unit, integration, or performance
2. **Create Test File** - Follow naming convention `*.test.ts/tsx`
3. **Add Mocks** - Mock external dependencies
4. **Write Assertions** - Include positive and negative cases
5. **Update Documentation** - Document test purpose and coverage

### Test-Driven Development
1. **Write Failing Test** - Define expected behavior
2. **Implement Feature** - Make test pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
4. **Verify Coverage** - Ensure adequate test coverage

### Continuous Integration
- Tests run on every commit
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Performance regression detection
- Automated quality gates

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Mock Failures** - Ensure external services are properly mocked
2. **Async Timeouts** - Increase timeout for slow operations
3. **Memory Issues** - Check for proper cleanup in tests
4. **Coverage Gaps** - Add tests for uncovered code paths

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run specific test file
npx jest tests/server/ai.test.ts

# Run tests with debug output
npx jest --verbose

# Run tests with coverage and open report
npm run test:coverage && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### Test Writing
- ✅ **Clear Test Names** - Describe what is being tested
- ✅ **Arrange-Act-Assert** - Structure tests clearly
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - One concept per test
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Tests should not depend on external state
- ✅ **Fast Execution** - Keep tests quick for developer feedback

### Mock Strategy
- ✅ **Mock External APIs** - Prevent flaky tests
- ✅ **Mock Database** - Use in-memory alternatives
- ✅ **Mock File System** - Avoid side effects
- ✅ **Preserve Behavior** - Mocks should reflect real behavior

### Performance Testing
- ✅ **Set Realistic Benchmarks** - Based on production requirements
- ✅ **Test Under Load** - Simulate realistic usage patterns
- ✅ **Monitor Resources** - CPU, memory, network usage
- ✅ **Identify Bottlenecks** - Find performance critical paths

## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Before Deployment
- ✅ **All Tests Pass** - No failing tests allowed
- ✅ **Coverage > 80%** - Minimum line coverage requirement
- ✅ **Performance Within Limits** - All benchmarks met
- ✅ **No Critical Issues** - Security and reliability checks pass
- ✅ **Documentation Updated** - Test docs reflect changes
